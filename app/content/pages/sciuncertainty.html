		<h1>Communicating Scientific Uncertainty</h1>
		<p>Our interdisciplinary research group combines expertise from Earth and environmental sciences, data visualization and transdisciplinary course development and teaching to explore the communication of scientific uncertainty through research, teaching and public engagement activities. Below are summaries of our main projects:</p>

		<h2>Making uncertainties visibles: New approaches to uncertainty visualization</h2>
		<p>The project focuses on improving communication from experts to experts and from experts to nonexperts with regard to scientific uncertainties associated with earth and environmental data, models and predictions. We do this by applying different methods to sample datasets to quantify uncertainties. We then compare, evaluate and improve these methods for communication with experts and non-experts using different approaches such as eye-tracking, decision-making tasks and survey questionnaires. The knwoledge gained will be used in the development of a learning module on the topic on scientific uncertainty for teaching and learning at universities. This project was awarded the <b>Dr. K.H. Eberle Prize</b> in 2024.<a href="https://uni-tuebingen.de/universitaet/aktuelles-und-publikationen/pressemitteilungen/newsfullview-pressemitteilungen/article/unsicherheiten-sichtbar-machen/">(Read more)</a></p>

		<h2>Training School</h2>
		<p>We are organizing an in-person training workshop to equip Early Career Researchers with knowledge and skills needed to effectively account for and communicate uncertainty ingeosciences with their peers and the public audience(s). The workshop is motivated by a need for achieving meaningful insights from geosciences outputs (e.g., maps, interpretations, models, simulations, time series) which are used for decision-making, but often presented unaccompanied by uncertainty estimates. The content focus will be on uncertainty communication related to global challenges (disaster risk and climate change) for which geosciences have an essential role to play in finding solutions. This workshop is sponsored by the <b>European Geosciences Union Training Schools</b> in 2024. The workshop will be held at the University of Tübingen (Germany) on March 17-19, 2025. More information will be available here soon.</p>

		<h2>Public Engagment & Outreach</h2>
		<p>We organized a series of activities and events as part of the Tübingen Science & Innovation Days 2024, which have the motto “Besser streiten” (argue better). The aim was to raise awareness of the challenges of visualizing uncertainties and promote a transparent dialogue between science and society. Activities included an interactive eye-tracking station, a World Cafe discussion depicting uncertainities in graphics, and a panel discussion exloring scientific data in everyday visual communication.<a href="https://tinyurl.com/yve4usam">(Read more)</a></p>

		<h2>Engaging the scientific community</h2>
		<p>We are organizing a scientific session at the 2025 European Geosciences Union titled 'How to communicate uncertainty to non-expert audiences'. This session encourages scientists to share their work and join a community of practice to inform and advance the effective communication of uncertainty in Earth and space science. Abstract deadline is January 15, 2025. Read more <a href="https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU25/session/52024">(here)</a> and consider submiting an abstract</p>
