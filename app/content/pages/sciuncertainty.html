		<h1>Communicating Scientific Uncertainty</h1>
		<p>Our interdisciplinary research group combines expertise from Earth and environmental sciences, data visualization and transdisciplinary course development and teaching to explore the communication of scientific uncertainty through research, teaching and public engagement activities. Below are summaries of our main projects:</p>

		<h2>Making uncertainties visibles: New approaches to uncertainty visualization</h2>
		<p>The project focuses on improving communication from experts to experts and from experts to nonexperts with regard to scientific uncertainties associated with earth and environmental data, models
		and predictions. We do this by applying different methods to sample datasets to quantify uncertainties. We then compare, evaluate and improve these methods for communication with experts and non-experts using different approaches such as eye-tracking, decision-making tasks and survey questionnaires. The knwoledge gained will be used in the development of a learning module on the topic on scientific uncertainty for teaching and learning at universities. This project was awarded the Dr. K.H. Eberle Prize in 2024</p>

		<h2>Scientific Uncertainty & Public Engagment</h2>
		<p> We organized a series of activities and events as part of the Tübingen Science & Innovation Days 2024, which have the motto “Besser streiten” (argue better). The aim was to raise awareness of the challenges of visualizing uncertainties and promote a transparent dialogue between science and society. Activities included an interactive eye-tracking station, a World Cafe discussion depicting uncertainities in graphics, and a panel discussion exloring scientific data in everyday visual communication.</p>
