		<h1>Understanding Mountain Landscapes</h1>
		<p> I am interested in understanding how mountain hazards are linked to mountain building processes, continental deformation rates and erosion. To do that, I use an extensive toolset (such as GPS geodesy, geochronology and terrestrial remote sensing) to investigate spatiotemporal patterns of deformation and erosion in the Himalaya-Tibet orogen and European Alps. Below are summaries of my main projects.</p>

		<h2>European Alps</h2>
		<p> I use terrestrial remote sensing (LiDAR) to detect and monitor rockfall activity in deglaciated alpine valleys located in the Swiss Alps. Using terrestrial laser scans data, I calculate rockwall retreat rates under present-day conditions and their temporal change since deglaciation.</p>
