		<h2>Understanding the Unknowns: Communicating Uncertainty as a Driving Force for Geosciences</h2>
		
		<p>This 3-day in-person training workshop aims to equip Early Career Researchers with knowledge and skills needed to effectively account for and communicate uncertainty in
		geosciences with their peers and the public audience(s). The workshop is motivated by a need for achieving meaningful insights from geosciences outputs (e.g., maps,
		models, simulations, time series) which are used for decision-making, but often presented unaccompanied by uncertainty estimates. The content focus will be
		on uncertainty communication related to global challenges (disaster risk and climate change) for which geosciences have an essential role to play in finding solutions.</p>

		<h2>Dates & Location</h2>
		<p>Dates: March 17-19, 2025</p>
		<p>Location: University of Tübingen, Germany</p>
		
		<h2>Making uncertainties visibles: New approaches to uncertainty visualization</h2>
		<p>The project focuses on improving communication of scientific uncertainties associated with earth and environmental data, models and predictions. We do this by applying different methods to sample datasets to quantify uncertainties. We then compare, evaluate and improve these methods for communication with experts and non-experts using different approaches such as eye-tracking, decision-making tasks and survey questionnaires. The knwoledge gained will be used in the development of a learning module on the topic of scientific uncertainty for teaching at universities. This project was awarded the <b>Dr. K.H. Eberle Prize</b> in 2024.<a href="https://uni-tuebingen.de/universitaet/aktuelles-und-publikationen/pressemitteilungen/newsfullview-pressemitteilungen/article/unsicherheiten-sichtbar-machen/">(Read more)</a></p>
